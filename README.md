## Project task
The task was to develop a website where users can search for a word and get a dictionary meaning of the word they searched for (through Dictionary API). Also the users should be able to swith from light to dark theme and change the typography of the font (serif, sans-serif or monospace). Users should be able to listen to the pronunciation of the word by clicking on the play button (this functionality hasn't been developed, TBA).

## Project overview
Had some fun with the nicely done design and came across the user managed font change for the first time so also had fun with that. Rest of the project wasn't that demanding a simple call to the API after a click on the search button and displaying of the information from the response. As I mentioned pronunciation is still to be implemented,
